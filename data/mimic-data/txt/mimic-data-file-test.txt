History of Present Illness:
This 81 year old woman has a history of COPD. Over the past five

years she has had progressive difficulties with her breathing.
In
2118-6-4 she was admitted to Hospital1 18 for respiratory failure
due
to a COPD exacerbation. Due to persistent hypoxemia, she
required
intubation and a eventual bronchoscopy on 2118-6-9 revealed marked

narrowing of the airways on expiration consistent with
tracheomalacia.
She subsequently underwent placement of two
silicone stents, one in the left main stem and one in the
trachea. During the admission the patient had complaints of
chest
pain and ruled out for an MI. She was subsequently discharged to

Hospital1  for physical and pulmonary rehab. Repeat bronchoscopy
on
2118-8-1 revealed granulation tissue at the distal right lateral
wall of the tracheal stent. There was significant malacia of the

peripheral and central airways with complete collapse of the
airways on coughing and forced expiration. Small nodules were
also noted on the vocal cords. She has noticed improvement in
her
respiratory status, but most recently has been in discussion
with Dr. First Name4 (NamePattern1) 951 Last Name (NamePattern1) 952 regarding possible tracheobronchial plasty

with mesh. Tracheal stents d/c 2119-4-19 in anticipation of
surgery.
In terms of symptoms, she describes many years of intermittent
chest pain that she describes as left sided and occurring at any

time. Currently, she notices it about three times a week, and
states that it seems to resolve after three nitroglycerin.
She currently is dependent on oxygen and wears 1.5-2 liters
around the clock. She has frequent coughing and brings up "dark
sputum".

History of Present Illness:
87 yo F with h/o CHF, COPD on 5 L oxygen at baseline,
tracheobronchomalacia s/p stent, presents with acute dyspnea
over several days, and lethargy. This morning patient developed
an acute worsening in dyspnea, and called EMS. EMS found patient
tachypnic at saturating 90% on 5L. Patient was noted to be
tripoding. She was given a nebulizer and brought to the ER.
.
According the patient's husband, she was experiencing symptoms
consistent with prior COPD flares. Apparently patient was
without cough, chest pain, fevers, chills, orthopnea, PND,
dysuria, diarrhea, confusion and neck pain. Her husband is a
physician and gave her a dose of levaquin this morning.
.
In the ED, patient was saturating 96% on NRB. CXR did not reveal
any consolidation. Per report EKG was unremarkable. Laboratory
evaluation revealed a leukocytosis if 14 and lactate of 2.2.
Patient received combivent nebs, solumedrol 125 mg IV x1,
aspirin 325 mg po x1. Mg sulfate 2 g IV x1, azithromycin 500 mg
IVx1, levofloxacin 750 mg IVx1, and Cefrtiaxone 1g IVx1. Patient
became tachpnic so was trialed on non-invasive ventilation but
became hypotensive to systolics of 80, so noninvasive was
removed and patient did well on NRB and nebulizers for about 2
hours. At that time patient became agitated, hypoxic to 87% and
tachypnic to the 40s, so patient was intubated. Post intubation
ABG was 7.3/60/88/31. Propafol was switched to
fentanyl/midazolam for hypotension to the 80s. Received 2L of
NS. On transfer, patient VS were 102, 87/33, 100% on 60% 450 x
18 PEEP 5. Patient has peripheral access x2.
.
In the ICU, patient appeared comfortable.
